# Description / Target Audience

 - **Main target**: students in the CS field interested in building their own software product (assuming majority) but also students who want to develop a physical product
 - A quick overview of product development and planning (identifying a missing piece in the market, developing prototypes, identifying potential vulnerabilities, target user base, development & iterating & validation, addressing competition)
 - Brief overview of the technical skills required for making a user interface and to implement machine learning to optimize their product if they want to
 - Introduce students to the different phases of ‘pitching’ and ‘fundraising’ for their product and teach how to make a basic pitch deck

# Course Objectives & Content

 - Case studies of successful startups (AirBnB, Cursor, Brick) and failures (Theranos, Quibi)
 - Bring in guest speakers who currently trying to grow their startup at YC (personal connections)
 - Incorporation of ML: Talk about how many popular apps use different algorithms (KNN, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc) to predict or optimize customer / user behavior (Beli, TikTok, Google Maps) 
 - **End Project**: Groups will each pitch their project / project idea and the class can decide whether or not they would invest, talk about predicted obstacles, discuss what materials or additional funding they would need and how much stake they would offer their investors

# Timeline

 - **Start Up Basics** (creating a pitch deck, process of developing a product, going over case studies, bringing in a guest speaker [guest speaker from the entrepreneurship/startup/YC field - ONE DAY]) – FOUR DAYS
 - Create Product Prototypes (organize into groups of 3-4 depending on industry interests; for CS products: use code-free developer to model a user interface (using Figma); for Mech products: use Onshape or some other simplified CAD website; fully develop the concept of their product; work together to create a pitch deck) – FOUR DAYS
 - Pitch Days and Discussion (Shark Tank style but nice)  – TWO DAYS 

# First Class Plan

 - Problem discovery and generic solution – gauge the audience to determine problems they face every day creation
 - Introducing MVPs, gauge audience to think of instantaneous solutions to their problems and offer feedback/criticism 
 - Customer discovery - ask the audience who they think they could sell the products to
 - Acquisition channels - how to attract potential customers
 - Analyze current competition: company highlights, market vs product information, direct vs indirect competitors SWOT
