Great to see you here! I am Batu, a rising third-year student at Columbia University studying Computer Science and Economics. My interests lie in the intersection of artificial intelligence/machine learning methods, financial analysis, and natural language processing. Please feel free to look around my website!

My original website, [batuhanyeltekin.com](https://batuhanyeltekin.com) is undergoing major reconstruction as I am currently working on migrating the website from a Wordpress model to a MERN stack. This shall do for now.
